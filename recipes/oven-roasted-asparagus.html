    <p>The quickest and easiest way to trim your asparagus is to line up all the (clean) stalks on a cutting board, 
        then use a sharp chef’s knife to cut off the thick ends. That’s all there is to it! If you’re worried about 
        cutting at the wrong place, here’s a tip from recipe creator swedishmilk: “To remove woody ends, grab a 
        stalk of asparagus at either end and bend until it snaps. It will naturally snap where it starts to get tough.”

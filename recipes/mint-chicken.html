    <!--ingredient list-->
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite-size pieces</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>½ cup margarine</li>
      <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
      <li>½ cup chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>PIn a medium bowl, mix together the chicken pieces and garlic. 
            Toss with the flour just to coat, and shake off excess.</li>
            
        <li>Heat the margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
            Add the chicken pieces; cook and stir until browned. Add the 
            mint leaves and lemon juice, cover and steam for about 5 minutes, 
            just until the chicken is cooked through. Do not over cook the 
            chicken or it will be tough.</li>
    </ol>
